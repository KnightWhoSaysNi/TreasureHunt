# TreasureHunt

This is a mobile game thas is supposed to resemble a scavanger/treasure hunt. A player can both create a game for him/herself and play an already created treasure hunt. 
Treasure hunt is divided into problems and problems consist of one or more tasks. A task could be a riddle, a question or a simple text pointing the player to the solution. Each task can have one or more hints, which can be revealed with points received as a reward for solving a problem. All tasks must have a text answer, but they can also have a geographic location as a solution. The player can then go to that location in real world and solve the task simply by being in the set radius of the location's longitude and latitude. Tasks with location as a possible solution can be solved by either by going to that location physically, inputting the coordinates in appropriate fields or by giving a text answer. Each solved problem reveals the next one, but tasks can be solved in no particular order. 

There is no reward at the end for solving all problems. The game is meant to played by two or more people, as its main purpose is to go outside and socialize.

This was my first attempt at making a Unity game. Despite the premise the game doesn't deliver in the visual aspect, nor in the gameplay itself. But it was an important stepping stone in learning Unity and I had fun creating it.
